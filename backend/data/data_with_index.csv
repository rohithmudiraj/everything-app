EPIC,Enterprise Property Information Center,"Property-related data is needed to support overall use cases and analytics.  Currently, property data is sourced from MRDW NZ, MRW NZ, and OASIS data extracts sent to CX team via weekly email.  The CX team combines information from all sources into one master_property table which is stored in Analytical Workspace.  No one specific use case requires EPIC data, instead virtually every use case or analysis will use it.  In addition to the current data, the use cases require further data fields from EPIC.

EPIC provides a repository for all pertinent hotel data and to distribute them to various channels thru Single Image Hotel.

Marriott's Enterprise Property Information Center (EPIC) is a centralized database that collects, stores, and distributes property information for all Marriott hotels. EPIC houses approximately 3,500 fields of data that are currently used by more than 60 internal/external systems.

Property profiles accessible through the EPIC web site allow users to maintain data on amenities, physical attributes, airport information, local area information, etc. EPIC streamlines the data collection and distribution process for hotels while maintaining a high standard of quality and consistency across key systems.

,Salesforce HVMB  Prod,"HVMB currently utilizes the Salesforce SaaS platform to manage leads, opportunities, and the vetting process for prospective Home Management Companies (HMCs). Once the onboarding process is completed, HMC properties are listed on the HVMB site for reservations. However, the current manual onboarding process limits our capacity to onboard multiple HMCs simultaneously. The HVMB Salesforce org is currently operational in production.   The project's goal is to develop a client-facing portal that allows HMC leads to log in and access all onboarding applications in one central location. They can complete each required task and track their progress as they work towards becoming official HVMB partners. Additionally, this portal enables prospective partners to self-manage the process flow at their own pace without requiring constant assistance from the HVMB team.   Overall, this project will boost Business Development Leader productivity by 30%. The cost of expanding the number of HMCs would be equivalent to hiring 4 new Business Development Managers, assuming an average salary. This change would result in a minimum of $300,000 in annual cost savings. Additionally, it will improve the experience of our HMC partners and advance our objective of becoming the preferred brand to partner with in the short-term rental industry",Salesforce-HVMB-APPRV,Soundar Muthukrishnan,Salesforce-HVMB-L3-Support,,Salesforce-HVMB-APPRV,,Salesforce-HVMB-PROB,,,Nitin Sood,Hitesh Mihani,Application Production Support,nan,1,844

Pass Through Software,PMS Interface Pass Through,"SER0017240 ""Pass Through Software"" configuration is interim solution to allow existing on-premise FOSSE and LightSpeed PMS servers to proxy interface communication from legacy PMS interface vendors.  ""Passthrough Software"" is name given to the solution which utilizes socat (Socket Cat) utility included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, along with scripts to help configure and maintain socat processes as a system service for managing interface data I/O. Purpose of the proxy is to ""take over"" existing interfaces on the legacy PMS server and relay the interface traffic transparently to Comtrol LLCC interface middleware once the hotel is using Agilysys Stay PMS. Eventually Passthrough Software will be replaced by a DeviceMaster hardware appliance which will perform a similar function (transmit interface information to PMS).",Agilysys-Stay-Interface-APPRV-US-CAN,William Rosenberg,Agilysys-Stay-Interface-Dev-US-CAN,,,,Agilysys-Stay-Interface-PROB,,,Syed Asad,William Rosenberg,,nan,1,848

The WEM records from the Kafka topics are then consumed, aggregated, preprocessed and transformed into JSON contents, which are  finally posted to the AEM system.
For the purpose of migration, fetching data from WEM is done in two approaches - Initial Load & Delta Load. Initial Load is for the migration of the complete data from WEM and delta load for the WEM data which had been published after the initial migration was completed.

,Adobe Test & Target,"Adobe Target is mainly used by the Marriott Digital team to run optimization tests on M.com and the mobile app. These tests are changes to the website like different colored buttons, different page layout or completely different page functionality like multiple rates searches (searching for more than one rate type like AAA and GOV at the same time). These changes are measured for their effects on the end-users, if it is positive then the change is made permanent via changes to the Aries code base. Target is also used to provide quick changes to the site like emergency banners on the Chinese homepage giving information about the coronavirus. We also use Target to ""patch"" functionality on the website. We previously forced users who chose the AAA rate to enter a legitimate AA number or they could not book that rate.

Subject: FW: ServiceNow - remove my group-->Risk-Management-Apps-APPRV-AMER 

Hi Jeff,
Hope you are doing well!
I need some guidance.  I would like to remove my group (Risk-Management-Apps-APPRV-AMER ) from change request approval lists.  Based on Esther's recommendation below, I need to reach out to the Change Coordinator.   However I'm not sure who that is.

Let me explain….  We recently went to a vendor hosted model for our data and no longer hosted at Marriott for our iVOS application data.  So, I should not be approving for server changes, patches, etc.  How do I get me Group removed ?

METT,METT (Marriott Email Template Tool),"METT- is a web application that allows a user to build an email from a choice of MR approved templates and then enter various data selection choices.  At the end of each week the list of entered campaign selection data is sent back to Marriott and from there it is run through a SAS process that allocates the customer base into one of the campaigns that are created for that week. This all happens on internal SAS box here and the data is stored in Netezza. A report gets generated that tells the email team how many campaigns were created and how many customers were allocated for each campaign. Once they approve a process in Unica gets kicked off and it puts all of these campaigns together like any other campaign and sends them to Epsilon to be launched. So, this process for the most part is just the normal email campaign process. The METT specific stuff that Epsilon maintains is really only a web page to create the selection criteria.
