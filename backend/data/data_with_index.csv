Salesforce HVMB  Prod,,"HVMB currently utilizes the Salesforce SaaS platform to manage leads, opportunities, and the vetting process for prospective Home Management Companies (HMCs). Once the onboarding process is completed, HMC properties are listed on the HVMB site for reservations. However, the current manual onboarding process limits our capacity to onboard multiple HMCs simultaneously. The HVMB Salesforce org is currently operational in production.   The project's goal is to develop a client-facing portal that allows HMC leads to log in and access all onboarding applications in one central location. They can complete each required task and track their progress as they work towards becoming official HVMB partners. Additionally, this portal enables prospective partners to self-manage the process flow at their own pace without requiring constant assistance from the HVMB team.   Overall, this project will boost Business Development Leader productivity by 30%. The cost of expanding the number of HMCs would be equivalent to hiring 4 new Business Development Managers, assuming an average salary. This change would result in a minimum of $300,000 in annual cost savings. Additionally, it will improve the experience of our HMC partners and advance our objective of becoming the preferred brand to partner with in the short-term rental industry",Salesforce-HVMB-APPRV,Soundar Muthukrishnan,Salesforce-HVMB-L3-Support,,Salesforce-HVMB-APPRV,,Salesforce-HVMB-PROB,,,Nitin Sood,Hitesh Mihani,Application Production Support,"name: Salesforce HVMB  Prod; description: HVMB currently utilizes the Salesforce SaaS platform to manage leads, opportunities, and the vetting process for prospective Home Management Companies (HMCs).

Data in WEM system is sourced from WEM's DB2 database. This data from WEM is consumed using a JDBC source Kafka Connector and then loaded into the Kafka source topics.

Hi Jeff,
Hope you are doing well!
I need some guidance.  I would like to remove my group (Risk-Management-Apps-APPRV-AMER ) from change request approval lists.  Based on Esther's recommendation below, I need to reach out to the Change Coordinator.   However I'm not sure who that is.

Let me explain.  We recently went to a vendor hosted model for our data and no longer hosted at Marriott for our iVOS application data.  So, I should not be approving for server changes, patches, etc.  How do I get me Group removed ?

This all happens on internal SAS box here and the data is stored in Netezza. A report gets generated that tells the email team how many campaigns were created and how many customers were allocated for each campaign. Once they approve a process in Unica gets kicked off and it puts all of these campaigns together like any other campaign and sends them to Epsilon to be launched.
